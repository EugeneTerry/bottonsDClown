## In your meeting with Mike, here's that information that he wants people to provide when they want to book him for a party.

-[Parent name]
-[Child name]
-[How many children attending the party]
-[Address of the party]
-[Date of reservation]
-[Length of reservation in hours]

When people request a reservation, he wants them all listed in chronological order - closest date first. He also wants the ability to delete requests.

Once the party is over, he wants the ability to say if he or Leslie filled the reservation.
